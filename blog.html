          <h2>Blog overview</h2>
          <p>
            Blogging is story-telling. A good blog design becomes a part of the stories you tell.
            The storytelling quality of a design should never obscure or get in the way of reading the blog. 
            A good blog design tells a story— but is also be conventional and makes reading comfortable (don’t design something so unusual that it confuses readers!).

        <h2>Learn C++</h2>
       
        <p>
           About C++: C++  is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".
             The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to
              facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers,
               including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.

        <h2> Learn JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
             It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, 
             supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
              for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.
             In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

        <h2>Learn Python</h2>
        <p>
            Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
             readability with its use of significant indentation.
             Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, 
             logical code for small and large-scale projects.

Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.
 It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural),
  object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due 
  to its comprehensive standard library.
